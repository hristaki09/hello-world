## Hello World github repo test

My name is Hristo.
I study Java, Python and JS, also some HTML and CSS.

As github become the de facto standart for version
control, I'm interested in it.

I also work with VSCode and want to integrate git with VSCode.
Also want to test some action from command line.

I have some experience wth the old version control
software.

Let add some more text...
Hope all went smooth :)

Some **bold* and *itallic* test.
